        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Make dough: Combine egg, oil, and salt in a liquid measuring cup; add enough warm water to fill to 1 cup. Pour into a large bowl and knead in 3 cups flour until smooth and elastic. Cover with a dish towel and let dough rest for 30 minutes.
        <br><br><strong>Step 2:</strong> Meanwhile, make filling: Combine ground beef, onion, water, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl; mix thoroughly by hand or using a fork. Set aside.
        <br><br><strong>Step 3:</strong> Dust a baking sheet lightly with 1 tablespoon flour; set aside.
        <br><br><strong>Step 4:</strong> Roll out a portion of dough very thinly on a lightly floured surface; keep remaining dough covered with a dish towel to avoid drying out. Cut out 2 1/2-inch rounds with a cookie cutter. Place about 1 teaspoon filling on one side of each dough circle. Fold dough over and seal the edges using your fingers, forming a crescent. Join the ends and pinch them together. Place on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough and filling. Freeze pelmeni for 30 minutes to prevent them from sticking together.
        <br><br><strong>Step 5:</strong> Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a simmer. Working in batches, cook frozen pelmeni in simmering water until meat is cooked through and pelmeni float to the top, about 5 minutes. Continue cooking for 5 more minutes. Transfer to serving plates using a slotted spoon.</p>

    <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high. Season chuck roast with pepper and 2 teaspoons salt. Sear meat until browned on every side, working in batches if necessary, about 10 minutes. Remove from Dutch oven and transfer to a large plate.
    <br><br><strong>Step 2:</strong> Reduce heat to medium and stir in onion. Cook, stirring often, until softened, about 8 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in harissa and tomato paste; cook, stirring constantly, until caramelized, about 2 minutes.
    <br><br><strong>Step 3:</strong> Pour in wine and cook, scraping the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon to loosen any browned bits, until reduced by two thirds, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomatoes, bay leaf, chuck roast, and remaining 1 teaspoon salt. Reduce heat to medium-low and cover. Cook, stirring occasionally, until meat is tender, sauce has thickened, and flavors meld, about 2 1/2 hours.
    <br><br><strong>Step 4:</strong> Remove and discard bay leaf. Transfer meat from Dutch oven to a cutting board and shred using 2 forks. Return meat to pot and stir in pappardelle. Top with grated Parmesan cheese.</p>

    <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Place white and wheat flour in a large bowl. Add salt, yeast, and water. Mix until a wet sticky dough comes together, about 5 minutes. Scrape down sides of bowl. Cover with foil. Allow dough to rise for 18 hours at room temperature. It should not be too warm.
    <br><br><strong>Step 2:</strong> Punch dough down with a spatula and fold it over a few times.
    <br><br><strong>Step 3:</strong> Lightly grease a heavy-rimmed baking sheet with olive oil. Sprinkle generously with cornmeal.
    <br><br><strong>Step 4:</strong> Lightly spray a work surface with water. Place a long sheet of plastic wrap on the damp surface to hold it in place. Sprinkle plastic wrap with flour. Scrape the dough onto the floured surface. Sprinkle flour on top of the dough. Gently stretch and pull dough into a long, flat rectangular shape, 12 to 15 inches long. Bring plastic sheet to edge of prepared pan and flip the dough into the prepared pan. Reshape the dough, if necessary. Dust with flour. Cover with a light dry towel. Let rise about 2 hours.
    <br><br><strong>Step 5:</strong> Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
    <br><br><strong>Step 6:</strong> Bake dough in preheated oven until loaf is nicely browned, 35 to 45 minutes.</p>
